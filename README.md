## Overview

The **Audio Classification Project Using Deep Learning** aims to classify different types of audio signals using advanced deep learning models. By leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), the project achieves high accuracy in identifying and categorizing various audio inputs.

## Features

- **Audio Signal Processing**: Efficiently processes raw audio signals for classification.
- **Multi-Category Classification**: Supports classification across multiple predefined categories.
- **Real-Time Classification**: Capable of classifying audio signals in real-time.
- **High Accuracy**: Utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning models to achieve high classification accuracy.
- **Customizable Model**: Allows customization of the model architecture and parameters based on specific requirements.

## Dataset

The project uses a diverse dataset composed of various audio samples across different categories. Examples of datasets that can be used include:

- **UrbanSound8K**: A dataset containing 8732 labeled sound excerpts (<=4s) of urban sounds from 10 classes.
- **GTZAN**: A dataset for music genre classification containing 1000 audio tracks categorized into 10 genres.
- **ESC-50**: A dataset of 2000 environmental audio recordings organized into 50 classes.

## Methodology

The project follows a structured approach to classify audio signals accurately:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Gather audio samples from various sources and categorize them.
2. **Data Transformation**: Clean and preprocess the audio data, including noise reduction, normalization, and feature extraction (e.g., Mel spectrograms).
3. **Data Validation**: Ensure the quality and consistency of the data through validation techniques.
4. **Model Training**: Train the models using the preprocessed dataset, optimizing for accuracy and performance.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
